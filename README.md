# LUA for WatcomC Dos
LUA5.4.7 for WatcomC (e,g, FreeDOS)

Taken from here: https://github.com/lua/lua

Just a fork of LUA for use in DOS environments. Lua is free software and can be found at the link above. This version here just compiles with WatcomC in DOS environments. I own no rights on LUA. It's no problem to get LUA compiled with WatcomC.

Check SIMPLUA.CPP for a basic "tutorial" on very basic and simple LUA integration in C++.
