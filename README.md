# LUA_for_WatcomC_Dos
LUA5.4.7 for WatcomC (e,g, FreeDOS)

Taken from here: https://github.com/lua/lua

Just a fork of LUA for use in DOS environments. Lua is free software and can be found at the link above. This version here just compiles with WatcomC in DOS environments.

Check SIMPLUA.CPP for a basic "tutorial" on very basic and simple LUA integration in C++.
